            <p style = "font-size: 20px;">ToonTown originally released from Disney in June 2003. 
            The game was Disneys early take at an MMO and was massively popular until the later years.
            The game then closed September 13th of 2013.
            Since then the game has been run mainly by two groups that gained the rights to use ToonTown's design from Disney.
            The two groups are ToonTown Rewritten and ToonTown Corporate Clash.
            ToonTown Rewritten is more popular but people have gradually been moving to Corporate Clash.
            This website is meant to help people moving from Rewritten to Corporate Clash understand the differences in how both of the games play.
            In the sidebar are the important diffreences that are present.
            For people who don't know of ToonTown you are a toon that fights against the monopolistic cogs and thier efforts to maximize profits at any cost.
            You use gags in this endeavor to make the cogs laugh and destroy them from the inside.
